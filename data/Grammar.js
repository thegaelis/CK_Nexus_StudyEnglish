It’s used to talk about things that haven\'t happened yet and are going to happen at some point in the future.\nIt generally relies on the word \'will\' to indicate that something will happen in the future. For example:\n- I will go to the park tomorrow.\n- My dad will regret buying that shirt.\nAnd with the addition of the word \'not\', we can turn the simple future tense into the simple future negative. Here are some examples of this\n- I am not going to learn to ski.\n- Mum will not see that movie.'

    'The future continuous tense is a verb tense that shows an action happening over a period of time in the future. “I will be dancing all night” is an example of the future continuous tense, as it indicates an action continuing over a specific future period of time. Compare it to this sentence, written in the simple future tense: “I will dance.” Although this example indicates an intention to dance in the future, it does not refer to a continuous action over a specific period of time in the future. The future continuous tense can be confusing because it sometimes seems interchangeable with other future tenses.'
